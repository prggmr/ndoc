install_pathndoc is a simple php documentation generator.

It's purpose is to allow writing documentation in a template style as you would
a typical static website and compile it into static html layouts for 
distribution.

ndoc is currently in development and should not be used in a production 
environment.

The doc generator works using a Chapter based generation.

Note the info below is subject to change!

Each root level folder is represented as a Chapter each sub folder
within is represented as a section continuing in infinitity, each
file within a section and chapter is considered a page.

A visual representation would be ...

chapter_title
    |- section_title
        |- another section
            |- section_nested_page
        |-  section_page
    |- another_page

ndoc would produce

1 ) Chapter_Title
    1.1 ) Section_Title
        1.1.1 ) Another_Section
           1.1.1.1 ) Section_Nested_Page
        1.1.2 ) Section_page
    1.2 ) Another_Page

etc..etc..

Pages can be combined by simply appending a unqiue identifier
followed by a ___ to files.

Example:

chapter_title
    |- a___page_one
    |- a___page_two

ndoc would produce

1 ) Chapter_Title
    1.1 ) page_one & page_two

When generating docs ndoc does not analyze the content of pages
this is to allow page content to take any form. The content of pages is
parsed to allow for simple linking within and between pages.
